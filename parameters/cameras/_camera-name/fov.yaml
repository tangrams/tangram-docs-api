    applies_to: perspective
    description: |
        Sets the "field of view" of the camera, in degrees. Field of view has an inverse relationship with `focal_length`: higher values cause more exaggeration. If both are set, `focal_length` will take precedence over `fov`.
    example: |
        ```yaml
        camera1:
            fov: 80
        ```
