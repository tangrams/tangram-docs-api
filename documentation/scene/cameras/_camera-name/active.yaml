        Sets the camera which provides the active view of the map when it is first loaded. If multiple cameras are defined, only one may be active at a time. If multiple cameras are set as `active: true`, the behavior will be unpredictable (see the [yaml#mappings](yaml.md#mappings) entry). The [JavaScript API](Javascript-API.md) can be used to [get](Javascript-API.md#getactivecamera) or [set](Javascript-API.md#setactivecamera_string_-camera) the active camera.
    example: |
        ```yaml
        camera1:
            active: false
        ```
